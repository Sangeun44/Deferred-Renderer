## Passing data to G-Buffers (10 points)
From `standard-frag.glsl`:
* Camera-space depth of the fragment
* World-space surface normal of the fragment
* Albedo (base color) of the fragment.

## Basic scene shading (10 points)
In `deferred-render.glsl`,
* Lambertian surface reflection 
* Ambient lighting, so areas that would be very dark are slightly lit.
* Directional or point light illumination by at least one light source.
* a time-offset noise-based image. 
* Used fbm for noise
